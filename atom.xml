But not working well.</p><p>This is a <strong>log-like</strong> post for what I have doneand plan to do for my website.</p><h1 id="goal"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#goal"></a> Goal</h1><p>Have a really working website-with almost zero frontend knowledge 😄</p><h1 id="approach"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#approach"></a> Approach</h1><p>Make use of my limited frontend knowledge to read thecode of open source projects and build mine accordingto the licenses.</p><p>Not build from scratch, in a word.</p><h1 id="analysis"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#analysis"></a> Analysis</h1><p>The domain is easy to get.</p><p>The server is also not hard. But it is too much for myneeds. After all, all I need is a simple website thatdisplays something at minimum cost. Therefore, thestatic site, such as Github Pages, is the way to go.</p><h1 id="blog"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#blog"></a> Blog</h1><p>It seems that the most popular way to go is a staticblog hosted on Github Pages.</p><p>And I’m also most experienced with that, too. So, let’sbegin with creating a Hexo blog.</p><h2 id="ready-to-use-hexo-themes"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#ready-to-use-hexo-themes"></a> Ready-to-use Hexo themes</h2><p>The first intuition was to find some themes listed on the website of Hexo. Learn from others - that’s how one improves.</p><p>(I wrote this post on Sept 14th, 2018.Plenty of new ones are likely to beadded to <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo Themes</a>)</p><p>Here are the lists of some themes I found interesting while researching (links to demo):</p><p>Blog</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oniuo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.xaoxuu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material X</a></li><li><a href="https://go.kieran.top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TKL</a></li><li><a href="https://notes.iissnan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NexT.Pisces</a></li><li><a href="https://yanm1ng.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vexo</a></li><li><a href="https://geekplux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geekplus</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.cofess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pure</a></li><li><a href="http://sora3.coding.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gal</a></li></ul><p>Portfolio</p><ul><li><a href="https://sharvaridesai.github.io/hexo-theme-edinburgh-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edinburgh</a></li><li><a href="https://sharvaridesai.gitlab.io/hexo-theme-standrews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standrews</a></li></ul><p>Wiki</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.zthxxx.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikitten</a></li></ul><p>Doc</p><ul><li><a href="https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doc</a></li></ul><p>Themes with some good details</p><ul><li><a href="http://ochukai.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ochuunn</a><ul><li>brilliant front page</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://huaji8.top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one</a><ul><li>intriguing interactive element</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://hexo-theme-random.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a><ul><li>brilliant front page</li></ul></li></ul><p>The themes I decided to use (links to repo)</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cofess/hexo-theme-pure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Ruffianjiang/hexo-theme-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dawn</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/geekplux/hexo-theme-typing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typing</a></li></ul><h2 id="set-up-the-blog"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#set-up-the-blog"></a> Set up the blog</h2><p>Add themes as submodule of local git…done.</p><p>Register a disqus account…done.</p><p>Create a favicon…done.</p><p>Change the config…working.</p><p>Modify the source code…working.</p><ul><li>code block</li><li>inner bar</li><li>side bar for post</li><li>font</li><li>icon</li><li>bottom bar</li><li>…</li></ul><h2 id="details-detailed-details"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#details-detailed-details"></a> Details (detailed details)</h2><p>The first thing I decided to do was to changethe appearance of the <strong>code blocks</strong>. I am not abig fan of any additional decoration for it.</p><p>So I dived into the source code and looked forany codes related to <strong>“highlight”</strong>.The first thing I noticed was the partial<strong>styl</strong> files called “highlight”. I triedto edit it but nothing happened.</p><p>I know <strong>Stylus</strong> is a dynamic stylesheet preprocessor language.Maybe I need to think about how Hexo compiles it?After trying to delete some, nothing happened tothe website displayed.</p><p>Then I noticed, the only file that it needs is the<strong>style.css</strong> alone. By targeting the <strong>highlight</strong>class, succeeded to remove the extra decorations.</p><p>(I was thinking about the meaning of the Stylusfiles. But I gave them up considering all the cost,such as the need to import normalize.css, whichwould slow down the speed of <strong>such a small site</strong>of mine. And the most important problem is, I haveno deep knowledge about things like Bootstrap)</p><p>But the one left is… <strong>not beautiful</strong>.</p><p>The next step I took was to revisit the listof the Hexo blogs with theme source codes. Itseems that previously, I focused too much on theoverall “feeling”. Some of them, thou havingappealing effects, are exceedingly bad at details.One blog has light theme but dark code block.The codes found on another one is almostimpossible to read due to the similar colors.</p><p>Those were not good.</p><p>From the ones I leafed through, the design of<a href="https://github.com/xaoxuu/hexo-theme-material-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">material-x</a>stood out. Reading its source code, I created anot-so-bad highlight block for my blog.</p><p>Next modification I did was to remove the <strong>sticky bar</strong>.For some unknown reason, while the sticky bar of theoriginal blog would disappear as the user scrolls down,the one of mine never changed. It was always there andbeing distracting. This removal was not hard that hard.</p><p>One of the most heated issues of the originaltheme was the its line height. I have noidea why the author chose to make the lines“crowded”. I believe he had his reasons. But,unfortunately, I am not clever enough to figureout them on my own. So I decided to change boththe <strong>font</strong> and the <strong>line height</strong>.</p><p>Choices are always hard to make when they are many.I searched again and again and even read aboutthe difference between serif and sans serif (likethe history and successful applications by bigcompanies). I went to some online Wordpress themestores to see what fonts they are using. Buteventually, I just gave up and chose <strong>Open Sans</strong>instead.</p><p>The hardest one had not come yet. When I tried toadd my Instagram social link, I realized thatthe original theme did not support its <strong>icon</strong>.</p><p>The icons in graphic design was a mystery to me sinceI saw no image files in the code. How could the websitejust draw a shape? After searching around, I came toknow about the difference between <strong>SVG</strong> and <strong>iconfonts</strong>.</p><p>“Well, the svg sprite looks cool! I wanna use that!”</p><p>I managed to find the SVG sprite from the original theme.And hard-coding few additional SVG icons into it did notseem very hard.</p><p>But, the theme here used the “font-class” way to do it.To have additional icons, I need a way to change the ttffiles and maintained the original unicode. Or I need torewrite all the related codes and functions.</p><p>Changing all the codes was not impossible buttoo much to do right now. And I also need todebug the SVG sprite on my own without any relatedfrontend knowledge. The difficulty was unpredictable.Therefore, the “font-class” way still seemed good to me.</p><p>But now I need a way to “unpack and repack” the ttf icons.I tried to skip the “unpack” step by searching around to seeif I could find the original icons. But it was so hard tokeep the “names” of each icon identical in this way.Should I just delete all the unnecessary icons? Could Iuse some software to manage them?</p><p>It was not easy especially when I am new. After messingaround for quite a while, I suddenly found outthe online app of <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/#/select" target="_blank" rel="noopener">icomoon</a>could load the SVG sprite and regenerate the font filesI needed. I doubted if it was so common and obvious thatno one would ever have written a tutorial for me to learnthis information. And it could keep all the “names” of theicons, too!</p><p>I knew it was not a graceful way to do it. But it workedat least. It took some time for me to make the icon trulywork. But the hard part was over, although I still spenta long time figuring out how the side-bars worked.</p><p>The rest of the modification is all about small things,like fixing a logical statement, adding variables and soforth. I have written too much for a post so let’s stophere. If you are curious, you can read the “<a href="http://Readme.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Readme.md</a>” ofthe modified theme under my Github account.</p><h1 id="home"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#home"></a> Home</h1><p>I feel like having a home page, clean andcompelling, to serve as the “www” host ofmy domain, similar to the one of<a href="https://geekplux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geekplus.com</a>and my old home page.</p><h2 id="reference"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#reference"></a> Reference</h2><ul><li>my old website (local source code)</li><li><a href="https://xrlin.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xrlin</a></li><li><a href="http://ochukai.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ochukai.me</a></li><li><a href="https://geekplux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geekplus.com</a></li></ul><p>Now I need a break (´._.`).</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="background-story"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#background-story"></a> Background Story</h1><p>This is a sad story. It has been a while since my last website (a <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> run on VPS) “vanished”. I doubt it was due to misconfiguration of Debian’s crontab I used to auto refresh the ssl certificate or something like that. I think I will post something like the Nginx config of it later on my blog.</p><p>Ever since then have I had little time or energy to rebuild it, or more precisely, to maintain it. It is very tempting to use the WordPress again since it is so easy to make it run and so popular and so easy to find plugins. But the thing is, running on a VPS means it depends on some unstable services. When the VPS provider reboots the server, it is sometimes required to manually reboot Nginx service (or reload ssl keys refreshed by the bot of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>. Their bot was still beta at that time). And it is also very hard to maintain due to the cost of the VPS itself and other problems too.</p><p>So I decided to make use of Github Pages. It looks like I need to start from the scratch again: to buy a new domain since the old one was ugly and hard to remember, to configure the DNS, to reconfigure Zoho emails (I had 10 different emails for my old domain to register on different websites), to choose the theme of the blog, to decide the structure of the whole website etc. (I tried to use <a href="https://readthedocs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Readthedocs</a> for my wiki page, the page for all of my pure notes, and struggled to “fix” the package requirements for different versions of python of their codes <s>sad face</s>)</p><p>Long story short. Let’s dive into the main point of this post!</p><h1 id="process-of-setting-up-hexo"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#process-of-setting-up-hexo"></a> Process of setting up hexo</h1><p>Note: the following notes was written as a comprehensive tutorial.</p><h2 id="setting-up-environment"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#setting-up-environment"></a> Setting up environment</h2><p>Prerequisites:</p><ol><li><p>Github account</p><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> and sign up</p></li><li><p>Github Page repository</p><p>At least one repository to store the generated website on Github is required. Just go to your Github home page and <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a new repository</a> following the instruction. You can either create it as a public or private repo. Other people cannot see the content of your private repo but since your Github page will be published you website will eventually be public.</p><p>There is a little trick here. If you name your repo as “YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME.github.io”, then your Github Page will automatically be published with that URL. Please read the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> for more details.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://hexo.io/docs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hexo</a></p></li></ol><p>In brief, install npm, hexo and create a Github repo.</p><p>That is almost all you need to host a website on Github for free! You don’t need to worry about SSL, don’t need to pay the fees for renting a server. So awesome thanks to Github!</p><h2 id="structure"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#structure"></a> Structure</h2><p>Like I said before, previously I had different subdomains for different purposes. I had wiki, blog, me, doc, etc. And I used one simple page as the whole “site map” for all of them.</p><p>Same thing again for me.</p><p>Other choices may include:</p><ul><li>use one and only one website for the blog</li><li>use hexo as a “show off” page to “show off” the frontend skills (something like a portfolio)</li><li>use Github Pages as a website to host demo web applications</li><li>and many many more!</li></ul><h2 id="choosing-theme-for-hexo"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#choosing-theme-for-hexo"></a> Choosing theme for hexo</h2><p>Since I use hexo for most of my web sites, it’s crucial to have a pretty and fit theme.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="个人对于密码设置的建议"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#个人对于密码设置的建议"></a> 个人对于密码设置的建议</h1><p>本文只是个人建议，仅供参考，写出来主要给自己留个note</p><p><s>其实写这个原因是没多少人写</s></p><p>这里先<strong>简单</strong>说一下密码是怎么破解的。</p><p>首先破解者能够访问输入用户名和密码的地方，要先找到门口。第一层防御就是隐藏这个访问点。</p><ul><li>对于端口，可以调高指定端口，但是所有端口只有6万个，很快就能扫描完成。</li><li>对于网页，就可以用一些特殊地址掩盖真实的登陆页面。</li><li>对于wifi，可以禁止SSID广播。</li></ul><p>这时需要一个用户名和一个密码。</p><ul><li>用户名在许多情况下都是注册时候用的邮箱地址。为了在这一个地方防御住，需要用非通用邮箱注册。包括但不限于域名邮箱地址，一次性邮箱地址。</li><li>花花绿绿的hello@abc.xyz这样的域名邮箱听起来很神奇，看起来很神奇，其实很简单。简单的话可以去域名商购买一个低价冷门域名，然后forward到真实的邮箱。还可以去zoho这样的地方得到。</li><li>当然一般情况下都是知道用户名才会去尝试破解。</li><li>密码一般都是暴力破解。</li><li>注：破解密码和盗取密码不一样。如有些古老的网站会把密码用明文传输，直接抓包就行了。</li><li>为了从最有可能的密码开始尝试，可以用字典，彩虹表等。简单来讲就是最常见密码放在一起。例如生日，每年只有12个月，每个月只有30天左右，从当前日期往回倒退猜也不会有无限年份，用纯生日做密码是及其危险的。想一想有多少人把aabbccdd作为wifi密码。</li><li>当然如果密码泄露了，比如在坏坏的公共wifi登陆并进行危险操作，就不用暴力破解了。</li><li>防止暴力破解可以试试添加尝试次数上限（这取决于网络服务提供商）和两步验证。为了让其前功尽弃，还是经常改密码比较安全。</li></ul><h2 id="正文"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#正文"></a> 正文</h2><h3 id="step-1-生成一个纯随机文本"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#step-1-生成一个纯随机文本"></a> Step 1. 生成一个纯随机文本</h3><p>到了暴力破解这一步，只是一个时间问题。可以参考一下这两个暴力破解表格：<a href="http://widgetx.blogspot.com/p/brute-force-attack-time-table.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">暴力破解时间表格1</a>，<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/322lbk/time_required_to_bruteforce_crack_a_password/?st=ix3ejwue&amp;amp;sh=350cf8da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">暴力破解时间表格2</a>。为了让你的密码能够坚持到被暴力破解这一个步骤，不在字典攻击就被拿下，你需要一个纯随机的文本作为密码。</p><p>你可以自己写一个随机文本产生器，也可以用计算器自带的，也可以去应用商城下载一个。这里推荐random网站提供的<a href="https://www.random.org/passwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">随机密码生成</a>。</p><p>当然在大多数情况下，为了方便记忆，你还是可以自己想出一个接近于纯随机的密码。 可以弄一个西班牙语单词和汉语拼音的混合体，中间再加点你最喜欢的化学元素的中子数和标点符号。</p><h3 id="step-2-改编这个纯随机文本"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#step-2-改编这个纯随机文本"></a> Step 2. 改编这个纯随机文本</h3><p>费了这么大劲得到的一个纯随机文本，光记住都要再花一些时间，怎么能直接就用作密码呢？（大雾，为了安全，在最重要的地方还是完全没有使用过的纯随机密码保险）</p><p>可以试试在这个随机文本前面或者后面加上密码用途的标识符（如笔记就是ThoSto（thought store，思想存储，这样奇怪的东西反而好记也不好被猜到）），这个标识符可以用在你所有跟笔记有关的账户上，但尽量不要重复，可以改大小写和添加标点符号。然后在密码主题的后面加上你所注册的账户的<strong>唯一</strong>标识符，如印象笔记就是ImpLike（Impression印象，Like像），最后再随便加几个标点符号，如在ImpLike之间加一个下划线，在最后加一个感叹号之类的。比较有特色的可以把这个网站名字读50遍，然后把嘴里发出的那个音用拼音写下来当结尾。</p><p>每次设置新密码的时候可以把这3各部分的位置互换。</p><p>好了，现在最大的问题就是密码太长了，有些网站无法注册，裁剪即可。</p><h3 id="step-3-使用这个强密码"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#step-3-使用这个强密码"></a> Step 3. 使用这个强密码</h3><p>在注册新账户的时候在密码一栏填写就可以了。也可以把现有账户的密码改成这个。</p><p>当然也可以直接使用<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lastpass</a>这样的软件、浏览器插件。这里也推荐用该类软件保存非重要网站、账户的密码。强烈推荐<a href="https://keepass.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keepass</a>和面向Linux桌面的<a href="https://keepassxc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keepassxc</a>.</p><p>注意存放这个密码。网络安全最大的漏洞都是来源于使用者。都知道要改默认PIN，但事实上机会没有人会记得去改它。</p><p>注：此文不是对于保护上网隐私的描述。也不是防御网络攻击的描述。</p><p>注：本文为简单记叙文，内容没有经过严格验证。</p>]]></content>
